# MealWheel Flutter App
## Introduction
This app was a personal project that I developed when I was learning Flutter/Dart. MealWheel is a simple application that helps you chose what to eat. You enter however many food choices you'd like to add and then tap to spin the wheel. You can also reset the wheel and start again by tapping the reset button at the bottom of the screen. The app is available in both the Google Play Store and the App Store. <br>

This repository contains only the dart files of the Flutter project. This app was created with a modular design approach and makes use of classes, lists, loops, conditional statements, functions, and more. I also used try catch statements and customized flutter packages to fit the application idea.<br>
